# Even & Odd Number Detection in Python

## Overview
This repository contains various methods to check whether a number is **even** or **odd** in Python. Each method demonstrates a different approach using built-in functions, operators, and external libraries.

## Summary of Methods
| **Method** | **Approach** |
|------------|-------------|
| `%` Modulus Operator | Most common and simplest |
| `&` Bitwise Operator | Fastest for performance |
| String Formatting | Clean one-liner |
| `divmod()` Function | Uses quotient and remainder |
| Lambda Function | Short and efficient |
| `filter()` Function | Used for lists |
| List Comprehension | Pythonic way to filter lists |
| Dictionary Mapping | Quick lookup method |
| Recursion | Uses function calls |
| NumPy Arrays | Best for large datasets |
| `map()` Function | Applies function to each item |
| Generators | Memory-efficient iteration |
| Boolean Indexing | Compact list-based approach |
| Floor Division | Alternative mathematical approach |
| OOP Class-Based | Encapsulated in an object |
